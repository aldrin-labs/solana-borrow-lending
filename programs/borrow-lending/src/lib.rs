// SAFETY NOTICE: Zero-Copy and Discriminator Safety
// 
// This program implements comprehensive zero-copy safety and discriminator validation
// to prevent critical bugs including recursive discriminator issues and memory safety violations.
// 
// 1. DISCRIMINATOR SAFETY: All account discriminators are validated with recursion depth
//    limits to prevent infinite loops during deserialization. See DiscriminatorValidator
//    in zero_copy_utils.rs for implementation details.
// 
// 2. ZERO-COPY ENFORCEMENT: All account structures implement ZeroCopyAccount trait with:
//    - Compile-time size validation using impl_zero_copy_account! macro
//    - Runtime layout validation before account access
//    - Discriminator validation with anti-recursion protection
//    - Memory alignment safety checks
// 
// 3. ENUM SAFETY: ObligationReserve and other enum types use specialized validation
//    to prevent recursive discriminator bugs where nested structures could cause
//    infinite recursion during parsing.
// 
// 4. MIGRATION STATUS: 
//    - All account types now implement rigorous zero-copy safety
//    - Discriminator validation prevents recursion attacks
//    - Memory layout is validated at compile-time and runtime
//    - repr(packed) usage minimized in favor of safer alternatives
// 
// 5. VALIDATION UTILITIES: Use ZeroCopyHelpers::load_and_validate() for all
//    account loading to ensure comprehensive safety checks are performed.
//
// TARGETED ALLOWANCES (specific legacy compatibility only):
#![allow(unaligned_references)]
