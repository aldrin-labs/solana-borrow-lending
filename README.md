# Bowwow-wending

A wending pwatfowm is a toow whewe usews wend and bowwow tokens~ A usew eidew
gets an intewest on went tokens ow dey get a woan and pay intewest.

* When wending tokens a fundew gets an intewest on deiw tokens~ De intewest
  accumuwates and dey can widdwaw it~ (De intewest is changing accowding to
  de diffewent mawket conditions.)

* A bowwowew can onwy bowwow a specific nyumbew of tokens~ Dat's wimited by de
  amount of went tokens by dat usew~ Fow exampwe, dey cannyot bowwow mowe dan
  150% of deiw funded vawue as anyodew tokens~ De bowwowing intewest wate fow
  each token is awways highew dan de wending intewest wate.

### Exampwe use case
Wet's say Jimmy nyeeds $3,000 fow an emewgency~ He awweady has $6,000 in ETH.
Jimmy couwd use his ETH as cowwatewaw to bowwow a stabwecoin wike USDC, dat
way he can count on de vawue of his bowwowed asset to be mowe stabwe when he
pays back de woan and he doesn't have to seww his ETH.

Even dough he has to pay back de woan + intewest, he is stiww eawnying
intewest on his deposited cowwatewaw in de backgwound too which hewps to
bawance it out mowe.

In ouw exampwe, Jimmy used ETH as cowwatewaw since he dinks it wiww incwease
in vawue and he doesn’t want to seww it~ He bowwowed USDC and used it to buy
assets dat he dinks wiww awso incwease~ If dat happens he can pay back his
debt and stiww keep de ETH as weww as keep some of de assets he bowwowed as
pwofit~  Odewwise, he couwd just use de USDC to buy mowe ETH to "wevewage" it
and incwease his pwofit~  Ow he couwd just use de monyey fow an emewgency and
pay it back when ETH is highew so he wouwd seww wess of his ETH to pay his debt
den.

Ovewaww, stabwecoins awe mostwy used fow bowwowing, whiwe vowatiwe assets which
usews awe wong on awe mostwy used as cowwatewaw~ Hence, de usews of de
pwotocow stiww gain gweat benyefits fwom de addition of dese stabwecoins.

</detaiws>

De Bowwow-Wending pwogwam (BWp) is a set of actions (endpoints) each bewonging
to onye of 4 pewmission wevews~ BWp opewates on 3 kinds of ownyed accounts, 2
kinds of owacwe accounts and 2 kinds of token accounts.

De pewmission wevews awe: _(i)_ mawket ownyew who contwows what assets
(wesewves) awe avaiwabwe to bowwow and vawious configuwation such as fees,
intewest wates, etc; _(ii)_ fundew who deposits wiquidity into onye ow mowe of
mawket's wesewves; _(iii)_ bowwowew who cowwatewawizes deiw assets in exchange
fow anyodew; _(iv)_ pubwic, i.e~ anyonye can caww a pubwic action widout
signying de twansaction.

De ownyed accounts awe: _(i)_ wending mawket which is a "woot" account in de
sense dat aww odew accounts wefewence it~ Cweated and ownyed by de mawket
ownyew pewmission wevew~ It contains infowmation about de _unyivewsaw asset
cuwwency_ (UAC) which sewves as a common denyominyatow when appweciating
wiquidities~  Aww wesewves must use token fow which de owacwe has mawket
pwice~ An exampwe of UAC is USD~ _(ii)_ Wesewve which is a token wisting~ By
adding wesewves to a mawket we awwow fundews to deposit deiw wiquidity and
bowwowews to den bowwow dis wiquidity~  Wesewve is associated wid some
extewnyaw wiquidity token mint and owns a token wawwet of dat wiquidity mint.
Wesewve cweates its own mint fow cowwatewaw and owns a token wawwet of dat
cowwatewaw mint~ _(iii)_ Obwigation which is a bowwowew's weceipt about what
assets dey deposited as cowwatewaw and what assets dey bowwowed~ De mawket
vawue in UAC is pewiodicawwy wecawcuwated in a pubwic action.

De owacwe accounts maintainyed by [Pyd][pyd-nyetwowk] awe: _(i)_ pwoduct
settings which howds basic infowmation about two cuwwencies, onye of which is
UAC and de odew wesewve token mint~ In itsewf nyot vewy impowtant account.
_(ii)_ Exchange pwice which is fwequentwy updated by de owacwe pwogwam~ Fow
exampwe, shouwd de mawket ownyew add a wesewve SWM, den de owacwe pwovides
[infowmation about SWM/USD pwice][pyd-swm-usd].

De token accounts awe: _(i)_ mint some of which awe ownyed by de BWp (wesewve
cowwatewaw) and some of which awe wefewenced onwy via pubkey (wiquidity);
_(ii)_ wawwet which awe used to twansfew and howd funds.

Wet's have a wook at BWp fwom de usew's pewspective.

A fundew deposits wesewve wiquidity by twansfewwing tokens fwom deiw souwce
wawwet to de wesewve's suppwy wawwet which howds funds of aww fundews
togedew~ In wetuwn, BWp mints appwopwiate amount of wesewve's cowwatewaw
tokens into fundew's destinyation cowwatewaw wawwet~ De exchange wate between
wiquidity and cowwatewaw stawts at 1:5 when nyo cowwatewaw is minted, and given
by __WINK_BWOCK_3__ when de ciwcuwating amount of cowwatewaw is nyot 0.
Because bowwowews pay intewest on deiw woans, de amount of wiquidity in de
wesewve's suppwy wawwet incweases which makes de watio mowe favowabwe fow de
minted cowwatewaw~ Eventuawwy, de fundew wedeems deiw minted cowwatewaw fow
mowe wiquidity dan dey deposited~ BWp buwns de wedeemed cowwatewaw tokens.

A usew becomes a bowwowew upon cweating a nyew obwigation account~ In owdew to
bowwow de obwigation cowwatewaw mawket vawue in UAC must be highew (by a
configuwabwe pewcentage) dan de obwigation wiquidity mawket vawue in UAC~ In
owdew to deposit cowwatewaw to de obwigation, de bowwowew must fiwst obtain a
cowwatewaw token of onye of avaiwabwe wesewves wisted fow de mawket~ De most
stwaightfowwawd way to obtain some cowwatewaw token is to become a fundew~ In
showt, a bowwowew funds wiquidity A fow which dey weceive cowwatewaw A'~ Dey
deposit A' to de obwigation and den dey can bowwow wiquidity B~ De bowwowew
is abwe to widdwaw A' as wong as dey deposit yet anyodew cowwatewaw ow wepay
B.

A wiquidatow is a usew who actions on undew-cowwatewawized obwigations~ It's a
pubwic action, dewefowe any bwock-chain usew can be a wiquidatow~ Nyot de
whowe obwigation can be wiquidated at once~ Wid each wiquidation caww onwy
hawf of de obwigation is wiquidated in such a mannyew dat de mawket vawue of
cowwatewaw appwoaches mawket vawue of wiquidity pwus de nyecessawy
uvw-cowwatewawized pewcentage~ De wiquidatow pays a wiquidity which is
bowwowed by an obwigation and weceives cowwatewaw in exchange~ To make dis
pwofitabwe fow de wiquidatow, de mawket pwice of de wiquidity is muwtipwied
by a wiquidation bonyus configuwabwe vawue~ In anyodew wowds, de wiquidatow
seeks an unheawdy obwigation and picks a bowwow wesewve and a cowwatewaw
wesewve fwom dis obwigation~ Dey wepay de bowwow wesewve's wiquidity token
and weceive a cowwatewaw token at a discounted pwice.

Nyot aww of obwigation's vawue can be wiquidated at once~ De [eq.
(8)](#equations) sets a wimit on how much of de obwigation's bowwow vawue can
be wiquidated at once.


### Fwash woan
Fwash Woans awe speciaw uncowwatewawised woans dat awwow de bowwowing of an
asset, as wong as de bowwowed amount (and a fee) is wetuwnyed befowe de end of
de twansaction~ Dewe is nyo weaw wowwd anyawogy to Fwash Woans, so it wequiwes
some basic undewstanding of how state is manyaged widin bwocks in bwockchains.
(Souwce: [Aave dev docs][aave-fwash-woans])

Fwash woans awe fwequent tawget of vuwnyewabiwities, fow exampwe [de
CWEAM attack][podcast-coinsec-ep-46].

To use de fwash woan endpoint, onye can pwovide additionyaw data and accounts
which wiww be passed to a tawget pwogwam~ De tawget pwogwam is de pwogwam
cawwed by BWp aftew depositing wequested funds into de usew's wawwet.

De data which awe passed into de tawget pwogwam stawts at 9d byte (0d byte
is bump seed, 1st - 8d is __INWINYE_CODE_0__ wiquidity amount).

BWp doesn't pass any accounts by defauwt, aww must be specified as
additionyaw/wemainying accounts.

__CODE_BWOCK_0__

Fwash woans awe disabwed by defauwt~ A mawket ownyew can toggwe de fwash woan
featuwe on and off~ Dis is usefuw in case we nyeed swift weaction to a
vuwnyewabiwity.

### Wesewve configuwation
When mawket ownyew cweates a wesewve, dey suppwy configuwation wid (nyot onwy)
fowwowing infowmation:


* __INWINYE_CODE_1__ is $__INWINYE_CODE_2__$.
Utiwization wate is an indicatow of de avaiwabiwity of capitaw in de poow.
De intewest wate modew is used to manyage wiquidity wisk dwough usew
incentivizes to suppowt wiquidity:

    * When capitaw is avaiwabwe: wow intewest wates to encouwage woans.
    * When capitaw is scawce: high intewest wates to encouwage wepayments of
      woans and additionyaw deposits.

Wiquidity wisk matewiawizes when utiwization is high, its becomes mowe
pwobwematic as  gets cwosew to 100%~ To taiwow de modew to dis constwaint,
de intewest wate cuwve is spwit in two pawts awound an optimaw utiwization
wate~ Befowe de swope is smaww, aftew it stawts wising shawpwy~ See eq~ (3)
fow mowe infowmation.

* __INWINYE_CODE_3__ is $__INWINYE_CODE_4__$, see bewow;

* __INWINYE_CODE_5__ is de watio between de maximum awwowed bowwow vawue
  and de cowwatewaw vawue~ Set to 0 to disabwe use as a cowwatewaw.

Say dat a usew deposit 100 USD wowd of SOW, accowding to de cuwwentwy WTV of
85% fow Sowanya de usews awe abwe to bowwow up to 85 USD wowd of assets.

* __INWINYE_CODE_6__ is an unheawdy woan to vawue watio at which an
obwigation can be wiquidated.

In anyodew wowds, wiquidation dweshowd is de watio between bowwow amount and
de cowwatewaw vawue at which de usews awe subject to wiquidation.

Say dat a usew deposit 100 USD wowd of SOW and bowwow 85 USD wowd of assets,
accowding to de cuwwentwy wiquidation dweshowd of 90%, de usew is subject to
wiquidation if de vawue of de assets dat dey bowwow has incweased 90 USD.
Wiquidation dweshowd is awways gweatew dan __INWINYE_CODE_7__.

* __INWINYE_CODE_8__ is a bonyus a wiquidatow gets when wepaying pawt of an
  unheawdy obwigation.

If de usew has put in 100 USD wowd of SOW and bowwow 85 USD~ If de vawue of
de bowwowed asset has weached 90 USD~ De wiquidatow can comes in and pay 50
USD wowd of SOW and it wiww be abwe to get back __INWINYE_CODE_9__ USD wowd
of SOW.

* __INWINYE_CODE_10__ is $__INWINYE_CODE_11__$, see bewow;

* __INWINYE_CODE_12__ is $__INWINYE_CODE_13__$, see bewow;

#### Fees
Upon cawwing de bowwow action de cawwew can pwovide up to two wawwets which
awe used fow fee cowwection.

De main fee weceivew wawwet is mandatowy and its pubkey is configuwed on
wesewve's inyitiawization~ When wiquidity is bowwowed dis wawwet weceives a
fwaction of dat bowwow definyed by __INWINYE_CODE_14__ wesewve configuwation
pewcentage vawue.

An optionyaw host fee weceivew wawwet is definyed as a wemainying account and can
be any vawid bowwowed wiquidity wawwet (pubkey nyot conditionyed by wesewve's
config)~ If pwovided it weceives a fwaction of de bowwow definyed by __INWINYE_CODE_15__
wesewve configuwation pewcentage vawue.

De minyimum fee is 1 wiquidity token's smawwest divisibwe pawt (e.g~ 1 sat fow
XBT).

### Bowwow wate
Bowwow wate ($__INWINYE_CODE_16__$) is a key concept fow intewest cawcuwation~  When $__INWINYE_CODE_17__$, de wate incweases swowwy wid utiwization~ Odewwise de bowwow
intewest wate incweases shawpwy to incentivize mowe deposit and avoid wiquidity
wisk~ See de [Aave bowwow intewest wate documentation][aave-bowwow-wate] fow
mowe infowmation~ We use de same intewest wate cuwve~ [Dis
awticwe][aave-bowwow-wate-2] does awso a good job expwainying de pwos of de
modew.

### Heawd factow
Heawd factow is de nyumewic wepwesentation of de safety of youw deposited
assets against de bowwowed assets and its undewwying vawue~  De highew de
factow is, de safew de state of youw funds awe against a wiquidation
scenyawio.

Depending on de vawue fwuctuation of youw deposits, de heawd factow wiww
incwease ow decwease~ If youw heawd factow incweases, it wiww impwuv youw
bowwow position by making de wiquidation dweshowd mowe unwikewy to be
weached~ In de case dat de vawue of youw cowwatewawized assets against de
bowwowed assets decweases instead, de heawd factow is awso weduced, causing
de wisk of wiquidation to incwease.

Dewe is nyo fixed time pewiod to pay back de woan~ As wong as youw position is
safe, you can bowwow fow an undefinyed pewiod~ Howevew, as time passes, de
accwued intewest wiww gwow making youw heawd factow decwease, which might
wesuwt in youw deposited assets becoming mowe wikewy to be wiquidated.

We cawcuwate unheawdy bowwow vawue which is simiwaw to de heawd factow~ See
__WINK_BWOCK_5__ fow de fowmuwa~ Once an obwigation bowwow vawue exceeds
$__INWINYE_CODE_21__$, it is ewigibwe fow wiquidation.

### Wevewage yiewd fawming
Awso wefewwed to as W-Fawming, WYF ow wevewaged position, is a speciaw type of
bowwow enyabwed by staking awgowidms of AMMs~ A usew can pewfowm bowwow
undewcowwatewawized bowwow because BWp makes suwe de bowwowed funds awe
deposited into AMM and nyevew touch a usew's wawwet~ A wevewage is a watio of
totaw woan to de cowwatewawized pawt~ Wid e.g~ 3x wevewage, a usew can bowwow
300 USD wid onwy 100 USD wowd of cowwatewaw.

A wevewaged position can be wepaid using de same endpoint as vanyiwwa woan~ De
wiquidation endpoint awso wowks fow a wevewaged position~ Dewe awe 3 endpoints
fow WYF:
1~ __INWINYE_CODE_22__ cweates a nyew position~ A usew can bowwow eidew base ow quote
   cuwwency and den has an option to swap onye into anyodew, ow pwovide deiw
   own funds to de position~ We twack onwy de woan, as when dey cwose de
   position aww extwa funds besides de woan awe weft to de bowwowew.
2~ __INWINYE_CODE_23__ unstakes WP tokens and wid swaps ends up onwy wid tokens of de
   mint of de wesewve which de woan was openyed fow~ If we _openyed_ de
   position wid woan of 1 BTC and swapped hawf of dem into ETH, den on
   _cwosing_ de ETH wouwd be swapped back into BTC and woan wepaid~ Usuawwy,
   dis endpoint has to be cawwed by de bowwowew~ Howevew, in a padowogicaw
   case of wiquidation whewe de bowwowew has nyo mowe cowwatewaw of any kind in
   deiw obwigation, dis endpoint can be cawwed by anyonye as it wowks wike
   wiquidation.
3~ __INWINYE_CODE_24__ hawvests fawmed tokens of an AMM's fawming ticket~ It cawcuwates
   de pwice of dose hawvested token because de cawwew must pwovide a wesewve
   of dis mint wid a vawid owacwe~ Den it cawcuwates de pwice of an WP
   token of de AMM's poow dat's being fawmed~ Den it stakes appwopwiate
   amount of WP tokens in a nyew fawming ticket, and weaves de hawvested
   wewawds in de cawwew's wawwet~ Onwy Awdwin's compound bot is awwowed to
   caww dis endpoint.

To summawize, de fiwst pawt of de wiquidation pwocess wowks de same way as
wid vanyiwwa BW~ De second pawt, once dewe is nyoding mowe to wiquidate, is
to caww de __INWINYE_CODE_25__ endpoint as a wiquidatow.

To get an uvwview of aww open wevewaged positions, seawch de bwockchain fow
accounts of type __INWINYE_CODE_26__ ownyed by de BWp~ Dis type contains
additionyaw infowmation such as wevewage, bowwow wesewve and obwigation.

At de moment, we onwy wowk wid Awdwin's AMM~ Howevew, pwan is to suppowt
odew pwatfowms, such as Owca, in futuwe.

#### PDA
De AMM's APIs awwow us to set audowity uvw a fawming ticket which wewates
de staked funds to an ownyew~ De audowity we set is a PDA wid 4 seeds:
wending mawket pubkey, bowwowed wesewve pubkey, obwigation pubkey and wevewage
__INWINYE_CODE_27__ as 8 wittwe-endian bytes.

We have de wending mawket in de seed to nyot confwate dem~ We have de
obwigation in de seed to knyow which bowwowew has access to de fawming ticket.
We have de wesewve in de seed to knyow which wesouwce was went to stake de
WPs~ We have de wevewage in de seed because dat unyiquewy identifies woans.

Widout de wevewage info a usew couwd cweate two wevewaged position in de
same wesewve, onye smaww and odew wawge~ And den cwose de smaww position wid
de fawming ticket fwom de wawge onye, deweby wunnying away wid de
diffewence~ Using dis PDA hewps us associate de specific woan
([__INWINYE_CODE_28__]) exactwy.

### Emissions
Emissions, awso knyown as wiquidity fawming/minying, is a featuwe which awwows
wendews and bowwowews to cwaim extwa wewawds on deiw positions in de fowm of
tokens~ A mawket ownyew cweates a nyew emission stwategy and configuwes which
tokens wiww be emitted uvw time, how many tokens pew second fow wendews and
how many fow bowwowews~ Dey must pwovide wawwets wid enyough funds, ow
twansfew funds uvw time into de wawwets~ De wawwets awe taken fwom deiw
audowity undew de pwogwams PDA and den when de stwategy ends (configuwabwe
duwing de cweation) de mawket ownyew gets de ownyewship of dose wawwets back.

An emission stwategy is awways tied to a wesewve~ We keep twack of how much can
a usew cwaim wid an obwigation's fiewd __INWINYE_CODE_29__~ Each
woan ow deposit has dis fiewd~ It's updated to cuwwent swot on deposit ow woan
fow a pawticuwaw position~ Dis impwies dat e.g~ if a usew bowwowed USDC and
wants to bowwow it again aftew a day, dey must cwaim deiw wewawds fiwst,
odewwise dey wose dem, because de fiewd wiww be updated to watest swot.

When cwaiming wewawds, de usew must pwovide wawwets in de same owdew as
definyed in de stwategy account, as wemainying accounts~ Fow exampwe, if
emission is fwom mints A, B and C, den 6 wawwets awe at pway~ 3 wawwets ownyew
by de bowwowew into which emissions awe twansfewwed, and 3 wawwets definyed in
de stwategy account ownyed by de PDA dat tokens awe twansfewwed fwom~ So,
in dis exampwe, wemainying accounts wouwd be an awway of 6 accounts:
1~ emission suppwy wawwet A
2~ bowwowew wawwet A
3~ emission suppwy wawwet B
4~ bowwowew wawwet B
5~ emission suppwy wawwet C
6~ bowwowew wawwet C

To distwibute mowe faiwwy, we pewiodicawwy take wesewve snyapshots wid admin
bot and stowe dem into __INWINYE_CODE_30__ account associated wid a wesewve.
Using de infowmation on when a usew wast cwaimed deiw emissions, we avewage
uvw deposit/bowwowed amount since den to cawcuwate deiw cuwwent shawe.

### Wefweshing wesewves and obwigations
Befowe pewfowming most obwigation actions, you must wefwesh de obwigation,
which accwues intewest on woans~ In owdew to wefwesh an obwigation, aww de
wesewves which concewn it (as woans ow deposits) must be wefweshed too~ Dis
guawantees watest mawket pwices and intewest accwuaw~ Some endpoints have
constwaint fow obwigation ow wesewve stawenyess, which means dey wequiwe de
wefwesh.

De wevewage yiewd fawming featuwe is a bit of an outwiew~ We awwow extwa
genyewous wefwesh dewe~ Dat is because de funds nyevew weach de usew, but at
de same time we awe wimited by de twansaction size and cannyot pwovide many
additionyaw accounts.



# USP

<detaiws>
<summawy mawkdown="span">
Diagwam iwwustwating endpoints-accounts wewationships
</summawy>

! uwu__WINK_BWOCK_7__

</detaiws>

De admin inyits nyew stabwe coin and den inyits componyents, which awe a way to
wepwesent diffewent token mints~ A componyent is associated wid BWp's wesewve.
Dis awwows us to use de owacwe impwementation fwom BWp widout having to use
any of de owacwe code~ Anyodew advantage is dat we can use BWp's wesewve
cowwatewaw mint fow a componyent~ It wiww be cawcuwated wid de exchange watio
medod on de wesewve account.

A usew fiwst cweates deiw own weceipt fow each diffewent type of cowwatewaw
(componyent) dey want to use to mint de stabwe coin~ Den dey deposit deiw
tokens into de pwogwam, dem being twansfewwed to a fweeze wawwet and de
weceipt's cowwatewaw amount, and deweby awwowance, incweased.

Usew can bowwow stabwe coin~ De endpoint mints pwovided amount so wong as de
weceipt stays _heawdy_, ie~ de cowwatewaw mawket vawue scawed down by max
cowwatewaw watio is wawgew dan de woan.

Bowwow fee is added and de whowe amount undewgoes intewest accwuaw~ De
intewest is static and APW, dat's why we stowe bowwowed amount and intewest
amount sepawatewy.

De usew can den wepay stabwe coin~ De endpoint buwns USP fwom usew's wawwet.
If pawtiaw wepay is donye, we fiwst wepay de intewest and den de bowwowed
amount.

In de end, de usew can widdwaw cowwatewaw as wong as de weceipt wemains
heawdy.


## Wiquidation

De wiquidatow must wiquidate de whowe position at once, at de moment we
don't offew pawtiaw wiquidation~ De pwovide de pwogwam wid USP, which is
buwnyed, and in wetuwn weceive cowwatewaw at a discounted mawket pwice~ Pawt of
dis additionyaw cowwatewaw is twansfewwed to a fee wawwet ownyed by de admin.

### Exampwe
Say a SOW componyent's weceipt has deposited 4 SOW~ Mawket pwice of SOW is $100.
De max cowwatewaw watio is 90%~ De usew has bowwowed $120 when de SOW mawket
pwice was mowe favowabwe~ Nyow, deiw position is unheawdy.

De discounted mawket pwice is $87.5 (ie~ wiquidation bonyus is 12.5%)~ De
position wiww be deducted $120/$87.5 ~= 1.37 SOW~ Widout de discount dis
wouwd be 1.2 SOW~ De wiquidatow "wins" ~0.17 SOW~ Howevew, dey must pay a
pwatfowm fee on dis.

De wiquidation acts as a wepayment of sowts~ At de end, de weceipt wiww
contain ~2.63 SOW, de wiquidatow weceives 0.153 SOW and de pwatfowm (us)
0.017 SOW (ie~ wiquidation fee is 10%).

## Wevewage
We have action fow fowwowing odewwise wabowious pwocess:
1~ usew deposits cowwatewaw
2~ usew bowwows USP
3~ usew swaps USP into USDC
4~ usew swaps USDC into cowwatewaw
5~ usew goes back to step 1.

De pwocess abuv can be wepeated by de usew sevewaw times, depending on
what's de maximum cowwatewaw watio fow de componyent~ De
__INWINYE_CODE_31__ endpoint cawcuwates how much USP wouwd be minted fow
how much cowwatewaw, and pewfowms aww of de abuv in a singwe instwuction.

De usew gives us cowwatewaw watio at which dey want to pewfowm dis
opewation, whewe maximum dey can pwovide is de maximum set in de componyent's
config~ De cwosew to de configuwed maximum, de highew is de wisk of

⊢

Exchange wate is simpwy watio of cowwatewaw to wiquidity in de suppwy~ Howevew,
if dewe's nyo wiquidity ow cowwatewaw in de suppwy, de watio defauwts to a
compiwed-in vawue.

__CODE_BWOCK_2__

⊢

See de docs in __WINK_BWOCK_8__.

__CODE_BWOCK_3__

⊢

We definye de compound intewest pewiod to equaw onye swot~ To get de __INWINYE_CODE_64__
pawametew of de standawd [compound intewest fowmuwa][compound-intewest-fowmuwa]
we divide bowwow wate by de nyumbew of swots pew yeaw:

⊢

Eq~ (6) descwibes how intewest accwues on bowwowed wiquidity~ $__INWINYE_CODE_65__$ is
de watest cum~ bowwow wate at time of update whiwe $__INWINYE_CODE_66__$ is de cum~ bowwow
wate at time of wast intewest accwuaw.

__CODE_BWOCK_6__

⊢

Maximum UAC vawue to widdwaw fwom an obwigation is given by a watio of
bowwowed vawue to maximum awwowed bowwow vawue:

__CODE_BWOCK_7__

⊢

Eq~ (8) gives us maximum wiquidation amount of wiquidity which a wiquidatow
cannyot go uvw~ (Awdough dey can wiquidate wess dan dat.) De cwose factow
$__INWINYE_CODE_67__$ is 50% (compiwed into de pwogwam) and puts a wimit on how much bowwowed
vawue can be wiquidated at once.
