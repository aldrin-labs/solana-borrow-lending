## Lending Assets

1. Navigate to the **"Lend"** section
2. Review available supply markets and APY rates
3. Select the asset you want to supply
4. Enter the amount to supply
5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

### Supply Markets Information
- **Total Supply**: Total amount supplied across all users
- **Supply APY**: Annual percentage yield for suppliers
- **Collateral Factor**: Percentage usable as collateral
- **Utilization Rate**: Percentage of supplied assets being borrowed

### Earning Yield
- Interest is earned continuously and compounds automatically
- Rates fluctuate based on supply and demand
- Higher utilization typically means higher APY
- Monitor rates regularly for optimization

## Borrowing Assets

2. Navigate to the **"Borrow"** section
3. Review your borrowing power and health factor
4. Select the asset you want to borrow
5. Enter the borrow amount (stay well above liquidation threshold)
6. Confirm the transaction

### Key Concepts
- **Health Factor**: Ratio of collateral to borrowed value
- **Liquidation Threshold**: Point at which position may be liquidated
- **Borrowing Power**: Maximum amount you can safely borrow
- **Interest Rate**: Cost of borrowing (varies by utilization)

### Risk Management
- Maintain health factor above 1.5 for safety
- Monitor liquidation price levels
- Consider price volatility of collateral assets
- Repay loans before health factor drops too low

## Understanding Charts

### APY Comparison Chart

## Risk Management
